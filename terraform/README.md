# terraform

This directory houses Terraform configurations for Gid:

- Definitions of GCP resources (Cloud Run services, Firestore databases, GCS buckets, Vertex AI indexes).
- Modules supporting multiple clients (multi-tenancy).
- Variables and workspaces to differentiate dev, staging, and production environments.

Use 	erraform plan and 	erraform apply to manage infrastructure declaratively.
